        <p style="color: aliceblue">I have only been doing photography for about 6 months now and I am loving the progress I am making so far. I just wanna thank all of my friends that helped me and also the friends that actually inspired me to pick up a camera and start shooting. I remember one of my friends forcing me to go in the cold to shoot this one shot and I was so mad but it was worth it haha! 

        <p style="color:aliceblue"> My photography to me signifies emotion, pain, vintage, dramatic, cinematic tones, and life. Thanks to my inspirations like Jessica Kobeissi Brandon Woelfel, Mango Street, Julie Trotti etc. </P>

<p style="color: aliceblue"> Hope you guys love the work I display and looking forward to making more for you guys!

<p style="color: aliceblue"> If you guys have any questions on photoshoots, edits, camera gear, modeling, inspiration, just shoot me a message on my email! I will try my best to answer your questions thereâ€¦..Thank You! </p>
